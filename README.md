# ARTIFICIAL VISION SYSTEM BASED ON A SYNTHETIC DATASET FOR A PICK AND PLACE APPLICATION
The purpose of this project is the generation of a new artificial vision system for the recognition of parts for industrial use. This system will be implemented within a Grupo Antolín® supply
chain that will in turn feed an assembly and assembly line. The system must be able to identify multiple parts and determine the optimal grip point for each part. This is defined by
its coordinates as well as the normal vector to the surface. In this way, a robotic arm with a gripping system by suction, suction cup or soft-robotics (varies depending on the piece to be
picked up) will be able to collect them. The multitude of gripping tools as well as the need for a gripping point determination system is due to the great variety of existing pieces with a wide
variety of shapes and sizes (1-30 cm).
